# MUSIC RECOMMDATION SYSTEM
This repository implements a music recommendation system using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) on a dataset from Spotify. The system predicts user preferences and recommends songs based on historical user interactions.

## Contents:
  1. Dataset:
     The dataset (data.csv) used for training and evaluation, sourced from Spotify's music collection.
  2. Code Files:
     music_recommendation.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the complete code for data loading, preprocessing, model training (NMF), evaluation, and visualization.
  3. Dependencies:
     Python libraries used: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn.
  4. How to Use:
     Setup:
       Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your_username/music-recommendation.git
       Navigate to the project directory: cd music-recommendation
       Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt (if applicable)
     Execution:
       Open and run the music_recommendation.ipynb notebook in Jupyter environment.
       Follow the instructions and comments within the notebook to understand each step of the recommendation system implementation.
